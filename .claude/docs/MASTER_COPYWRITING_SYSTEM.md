# Master Copywriting System

## Why This Document Exists

This is not a template. This is a system built from real conversations, real iterations, and real failures that taught us what actually works.

**The core truth:** Great copy is never written in one pass. It's healed through multiple focused checks, each looking for ONE thing. When you try to fix everything at once, you fix nothing well.

**Why order matters:** Every section in this document exists in a specific sequence because that sequence was discovered through iteration. The research comes before the writing because writing without research produces generic garbage. The AI pattern removal comes after the first draft because you need something to fix. The competitive check comes near the end because you need finished copy to compare.

**Why we repeat ourselves:** Some principles appear multiple times in different contexts. This is intentional. The principle "check your work, then check it again for something specific" must be internalized, not just read once.

---

## Part 1: Foundation Principles

### 1.1 The Iterative Healing Model

**Never try to get it right the first time.**

This is the single most important principle. Every piece of copy goes through multiple passes:

| Pass | Focus | What You're Looking For |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| Pass 1 | Structure | Does it have all required sections? Is the flow logical? |
| Pass 2 | Value | Does every paragraph deliver something useful? |
| Pass 3 | AI Patterns | Em dashes, passive voice, corporate jargon, filler phrases? |
| Pass 4 | Human Voice | Does it sound like a person wrote it? Read it out loud. |
| Pass 5 | Competitive Edge | Is this better than what competitors are saying? |
| Pass 6 | Emotional Truth | Does it connect to real pain and real desire? |
| Pass 7 | Mobile Check | Can someone scan this in 5 seconds on their phone? |

**Why separate passes work:**
- Your brain can only focus on one thing well at a time
- When you look for everything, you see nothing
- Each pass makes the copy incrementally better
- You catch different problems at different stages

### 1.2 The Anti-AI Checklist

AI-generated copy has tells. We must eliminate them ruthlessly.

**Hard Rules:**
- **Em dashes (—):** Maximum 1-2 per entire piece. Preferably zero. This is the #1 AI giveaway.
- **"It's important to note":** Delete. Always.
- **"In conclusion":** Delete. Always.
- **"Let's dive in":** Delete. Always.
- **"At the end of the day":** Delete. Always.
- **Excessive hedging:** "might," "could," "may" in every sentence
- **Parallel structure overuse:** Every sentence starting the same way
- **Abstract → Concrete → Abstract pattern:** AI loves this. Humans don't write this way.

**Replacement Strategies:**
Instead of | Write
-----------|-------
"It's important to note that..." | Just state the thing
"In conclusion..." | Drop it. The ending speaks for itself.
"This comprehensive guide..." | "This guide..."
"You might want to consider..." | "Consider..."
"At the end of the day..." | Delete entire phrase, rewrite sentence
"In order to..." | "To..."

### 1.3 Why We Are Marketers

We are not content creators. We are not writers. We are marketers.

**This means:**
- Every word must serve a business purpose
- We compete for attention in a crowded market
- Our copy must be BETTER than competitors, not just different
- We must understand what our audience actually wants
- We must deliver real value, not just promises

**The Marketer's Questions:**
1. What is the reader's problem RIGHT NOW?
2. What are they searching for?
3. What have they already tried that didn't work?
4. What are they afraid of?
5. What do they secretly want?
6. Why should they trust us over competitors?
7. What action do we want them to take?

---

## Part 2: Research Before Writing

### 2.1 Competitive Research Protocol

**Before writing ANY copy, you must:**

1. **Find 10+ competitor examples** for your specific angle
   - Search Facebook Ad Library, Google, industry publications
   - Screenshot and save examples
   - Note what's working (engagement, longevity of ads)

2. **Analyze their approach:**
   - What pain points are they targeting?
   - What promises are they making?
   - What CTA language are they using?
   - What's their emotional temperature (urgent, calm, empathetic)?
   - What proof/credibility are they showing?

3. **Identify gaps and opportunities:**
   - What are they NOT saying that matters?
   - Where are they being vague where we can be specific?
   - What claims are they making that we can beat?
   - What trust signals are they missing?

4. **Document your competitive advantage:**
   - List 3-5 specific ways we are better
   - These must appear in your copy

**Why this comes first:**
Writing without competitive research means writing in a vacuum. You'll produce copy that sounds good to you but fails in the market because you didn't know what you were competing against.

### 2.2 Audience Research Protocol

**Know your reader better than they know themselves.**

1. **Demographics (the basics):**
   - Age range
   - Location
   - Income level
   - Life stage

2. **Psychographics (what matters):**
   - What keeps them up at night about this topic?
   - What have they already tried?
   - What do they think the solution is?
   - What are they afraid will happen if they don't act?
   - What are they afraid will happen if they DO act?

3. **Language research:**
   - What words do they use to describe their problem?
   - What questions are they typing into Google?
   - What language appears in forums, Reddit, reviews?
   - Capture exact phrases, not paraphrased versions

**Why exact language matters:**
When you use the reader's own words, they feel understood. "This person gets me." That feeling creates trust faster than any credential.

## Part 3: Behavioral Psychology Framework

### 3.1 Core Principles

These are not tricks. These are documented patterns of human decision-making.

#### Loss Aversion
People feel losses twice as strongly as equivalent gains.

**Application:**
- "Don't miss out on $500+ savings" beats "Save $500+"
- "Stop overpaying by $300/month" beats "Pay $300 less"
- "Avoid [negative outcome]" beats "Achieve [positive outcome]"

**Formula:**
- "Stop [losing/wasting/overpaying] [specific amount]"
- "Don't miss [opportunity] before [deadline]"
- "Avoid [specific negative consequence]"

#### Social Proof
People follow the actions of similar others.

**Application:**
- "Join 100,000+ [specific people] who [achieved result]"
- "93% [measurable outcome]"
- "Average [specific result] for [type of person]"

**Requirements:**
- Numbers must be specific (not "many" or "thousands")
- Results must be measurable (not "felt better")
- Audience must be identifiable (not "people" but "busy professionals")

#### Scarcity & Urgency
Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Application:**
- "Limited spots available this month"
- "Only [X] [resource] remaining"
- "Offer expires [specific date]"

**Warning:**
Fake urgency destroys trust. Only use when scarcity is real.

#### Authority & Trust
People trust experts and credentials.

**Application:**
- "Board-certified [professionals]"
- "FDA-approved"
- "Licensed by [regulatory body]"
- "[X] years of experience"

**Requirements:**
- Credentials must be verifiable
- Authority must be relevant to the topic
- Never vague ("trusted by experts")

#### Reciprocity
People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application:**
- "Free [valuable resource] - no obligation"
- "Get your free [guide/consultation/trial]"
- "[$X] OFF your first [purchase]"

**Key:**
Give genuine value first. The gift must be actually useful.

#### Anchoring
The first number seen influences perception of later numbers.

**Application:**
- "Starting at $179/month (vs. $1,400 elsewhere)"
- "Save up to $1,000/month compared to [alternative]"
- "Was $500, now $199"

**Key:**
Anchor must be believable. Outrageous anchors backfire.

### 3.2 Using Psychology Ethically

**The rule:** Psychology should help readers make better decisions, not trick them into bad ones.

**Questions to ask:**
- Am I highlighting real benefits or creating fake ones?
- Am I creating urgency around a real deadline or manufacturing pressure?
- Would I feel good if my mother read this and clicked?
- Am I promising something we can actually deliver?

---

## Part 4: Copywriting Formulas

### 4.1 Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** Name the pain point
2. **Agitate:** Amplify the emotional impact
3. **Solve:** Present your solution

**Example:**
> **Problem:** Choosing a provider is confusing and overwhelming.
>
> **Agitate:** You're comparing dozens of options, trying to understand pricing that ranges from $25 to over $1,000, wondering if you're making the right choice for your health and wallet.
>
> **Solve:** Our comparison guide breaks it down so you can find the best provider in minutes, not hours.

**When to use:** When the reader knows they have a problem but hasn't found a solution.

### 4.2 Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

**Structure:**
1. **Before:** Current painful state
2. **After:** Desired future state
3. **Bridge:** How to get from here to there

**Example:**
> **Before:** You're paying $1,200/month for medication.
>
> **After:** You could pay as little as $179/month for the same results.
>
> **Bridge:** Compare providers and find one that accepts your insurance or offers affordable options.

**When to use:** When you can paint a clear picture of transformation.

### 4.3 Attention-Interest-Desire-Action (AIDA)

**Structure:**
1. **Attention:** Hook that grabs
2. **Interest:** Build curiosity
3. **Desire:** Create want/need
4. **Action:** Clear CTA

**Example:**
> **Attention:** Your cost could drop from $1,000 to $179/month.
>
> **Interest:** The difference? Choosing the right provider.
>
> **Desire:** Join 100,000+ patients who found affordable, effective solutions.
>
> **Action:** Compare providers now - free, no obligation.

**When to use:** Short-form copy, ads, CTAs.

### 4.4 Feature-Benefit-Emotion (FBE)

**Structure:**
1. **Feature:** What it is
2. **Benefit:** What it does for them
3. **Emotion:** How it makes them feel

**Example:**
> **Feature:** Licensed, board-certified clinicians
>
> **Benefit:** Expert medical oversight throughout your journey
>
> **Emotion:** Feel confident knowing you're in qualified hands

**When to use:** When explaining product/service details.

## Part 5: Headline Mastery

### 5.1 Headline Types

Headlines are the most important copy you'll write. 80% of people read the headline. Only 20% read the rest.

**1. Question Headlines**
- "Are You Overpaying for [X]?"
- "Which [X] is Right for You?"
- "Ready to [Achieve Result]?"

**2. Benefit Headlines**
- "Save $500+/Month on [X]"
- "Find Your Perfect [X] in 5 Minutes"
- "[Achieve Result] with [Method]"

**3. Problem Headlines**
- "Tired of [Problem]?"
- "Stop [Negative Action]"
- "Don't [Make This Mistake]"

**4. Number Headlines**
- "5 Things to Check Before [Action]"
- "Top 8 [Category] Compared"
- "3 Ways to [Achieve Benefit]"

**5. How-To Headlines**
- "How to Choose the Right [X]"
- "How to Save on [X]"
- "How to [Achieve Result] Without [Pain Point]"

**6. Social Proof Headlines**
- "Join 100,000+ [People] Who [Achieved Result]"
- "[X]% [Success Metric]"
- "Why [Impressive Number] Choose [Option]"

### 5.2 Headline Testing

**Never launch with one headline.**

Create 5 variations minimum:
1. Question format
2. Benefit format
3. Number format
4. How-to format
5. Social proof format

Test and measure. Let data decide, not opinion.

---

## Part 6: Body Copy Standards

### 6.1 Structure Rules

**Paragraph length:**
- Maximum 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- One main idea per paragraph
- More white space, not less

**Section structure:**
- H2 for major sections
- H3 for subsections
- Bullets for lists (3-7 items ideal)
- Visual breaks between major sections

**Sentence structure:**
- Vary length (short sentences hit hard, longer sentences add flow)
- Start sentences differently (not "You" every time)
- Use active voice by default
- One idea per sentence

### 6.2 Mobile-First Writing

**The reality:** Most readers are on phones. Write for thumb-scrollers.

**Mobile rules:**
- Front-load value (important info first)
- Make it scannable (headers, bullets, bold)
- Short paragraphs (a wall of text is a wall of "back button")
- Large, tappable CTAs
- Test on actual phone before publishing

### 6.3 Value Density

**Every paragraph must deliver value.**

Ask of each paragraph:
- What does the reader learn here?
- What can they DO with this information?
- If I delete this, do they lose something important?

If a paragraph doesn't pass, delete or rewrite it.

---

## Part 7: CTA Mastery

### 7.1 CTA Formulas

**Action-Oriented:**
- "Compare Providers Now"
- "Check Your Eligibility"
- "Find Your Match"
- "Get Started"

**Benefit-Included:**
- "Compare Providers Free"
- "Find Providers That Accept Insurance"
- "Save $500+/Month"

**Urgency-Added:**
- "Compare Now - Limited Availability"
- "Check Eligibility Today"
- "Find Your Provider Before [Event]"

### 7.2 CTA Placement

**Strategic positions:**
1. After explaining what to look for (they now know criteria)
2. After a compelling section (emotional peak)
3. After social proof (trust established)
4. At natural decision points
5. At the end (obvious but necessary)

**Not just at the end.** Readers don't always finish. Give them opportunities to act throughout.

### 7.3 Interactive CTAs

Better than "Learn More" - give readers something to DO:
- Debt amount selectors
- Savings calculators
- ZIP code entry
- Quiz starters
- Situation selectors

Interactive CTAs increase engagement because they trigger investment. The reader has now given something, making them more likely to continue.

---

## Part 8: The Review Process (CRITICAL)

### 8.1 Why Multiple Passes

**One pass catches 40% of issues. Six passes catch 95%.**

Each pass focuses on ONE thing. This is counterintuitive but essential. When you look for everything, your brain skips over problems because it's overwhelmed.

### 8.2 The Seven-Pass System

**Pass 1: Structure Check**
- All required sections present?
- Logical flow from section to section?
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)?
- Visual breaks where needed?

**Pass 2: Value Check**
- Does each paragraph teach something?
- Is actionable advice included?
- Are specifics given (not vague promises)?
- Would a reader learn something useful?

**Pass 3: AI Pattern Check**
- Count em dashes (max 1-2 for entire piece)
- Search for "It's important to note"
- Search for "In conclusion"
- Search for "comprehensive"
- Search for "leverage"
- Check for excessive hedging
- Check for repetitive sentence starts

**Pass 4: Human Voice Check**
- Read the entire piece out loud
- Does it sound like a person talking?
- Are there contractions where appropriate?
- Is the tone conversational, not corporate?
- Would a friend send this in an email?

**Pass 5: Competitive Check**
- Pull up 3 competitor examples
- Is our copy better? More specific? More valuable?
- Are we saying something they're not?
- Are we making stronger claims (that we can back up)?

**Pass 6: Emotional Check**
- Does the opening hook create feeling?
- Are pain points acknowledged?
- Is there hope/aspiration?
- Does the CTA feel motivating, not pushy?

**Pass 7: Mobile Check**
- View on actual phone
- Is it scannable?
- Are paragraphs short enough?
- Are CTAs visible without excessive scrolling?
- Does it load quickly?

### 8.3 The Check, Then Check Again Principle

**This is not optional. This is the process.**

You will find issues on pass 2 that you missed on pass 1. You will find issues on pass 5 that you missed on pass 4. This is normal. This is expected. This is why we do multiple passes.

Do not skip passes. Do not combine passes. Do not assume you caught everything.

---

## Part 9: Compliance & Legal

### 9.1 Required Disclaimers

**For medication/health claims:**
- "Prescription required"
- "Results may vary"
- "Consult healthcare provider"
- "Not FDA-approved" (for compounded)

**For pricing:**
- "Starting at [price]"
- "Prices may vary"
- "Insurance coverage varies"
- "See provider for details"

**For results:**
- "Average results"
- "Individual results vary"
- "Based on [study/data source]"

### 9.2 Claims We Cannot Make

- Guaranteed results
- "Cure" language
- Absolute statements ("always works")
- Claims we cannot substantiate
- Fake urgency or scarcity

### 9.3 Advertiser Disclosure

When content promotes paid partners:
- Clear disclosure at top
- "Advertiser Disclosure" or "Sponsored"
- Cannot be hidden or buried

## Part 10: The WHY Behind This System

### 10.1 Why Order Matters

This document is not a reference to dip into randomly. It's a sequence.

1. **Research comes first** because writing without research produces generic copy that sounds like everyone else.

2. **Psychology framework comes before formulas** because you need to understand WHY the formulas work before you can use them correctly.

3. **Headlines come before body copy** because if your headline fails, no one reads the body.

4. **Review passes come last** because you need finished copy to review.

5. **Compliance comes near the end** because you need to know what you're checking against.

**Skipping steps produces worse copy.** The time you "save" by skipping research will cost you triple when your copy fails to convert.

### 10.2 Why We Repeat Ourselves

Some principles appear multiple times in this document:
- "Check your work, then check it again for something specific"
- "Every paragraph must deliver value"
- "Research before writing"
- "Remove AI patterns"

This repetition is intentional. These principles must become instinct, not checklist items. You should feel wrong when you skip them.

### 10.3 Why Human Voice Matters

AI can generate grammatically correct, logically structured copy. So can a mediocre intern.

What AI cannot do well:
- Use language exactly as real people use it
- Create genuine emotional resonance
- Sound like a specific person with opinions
- Break rules effectively for emphasis
- Know when to be incomplete

**Human voice is our competitive advantage.** When readers feel they're hearing from a person who understands them, they trust. Trust converts.

### 10.4 Why We Iterate

**First drafts are raw material, not finished product.**

The writing process:
1. Get something on paper (ugly is fine)
2. Make it correct (structure, facts)
3. Make it good (clear, valuable)
4. Make it human (voice, connection)
5. Make it better than competitors
6. Make it compliant
7. Make it mobile-ready

Trying to do all seven in one pass is how you produce mediocre copy. Accept that the first draft is just the beginning.

## Part 11: Listicle Copy Layer

### 11.1 What Makes Listicle Copy Different

Listicles are not blog posts. They are conversion machines designed to move readers from awareness to action.

**Key differences:**
- Higher urgency (reader is actively searching)
- More competitive (multiple options on one page)
- Interactive elements expected (selectors, calculators)
- Offer integration throughout (not just end)
- Stronger CTAs (comparison, not just "learn more")

### 11.2 Listicle Structure

**Required elements:**
1. Hook opening (pain point or aspirational)
2. Quick value summary (what reader will learn)
3. Qualification section (who this is for)
4. Comparison content (structured, scannable)
5. Strategic offer placements (3-4 minimum)
6. Interactive CTA elements
7. Clear next steps

### 11.3 Offer Integration

**Placement 1: After explaining criteria**
Reader just learned what matters. Show them an option that delivers.

**Placement 2: After comparison section**
Reader sees options compared. Show them how to act.

**Placement 3: After addressing objections**
Reader's concerns resolved. Lower the barrier to action.

**Placement 4: Final comprehensive comparison**
Reader ready to decide. Show all options clearly.

### 11.4 Listicle Variation Testing

Generate 3-5 variations testing:
- Pain-focused vs aspiration-focused openings
- Interactive CTA vs direct CTA
- Brief vs detailed information density
- Urgent vs empathetic emotional temperature

Let data determine the winner.

## Part 12: Quality Metrics

### 12.1 Copy Quality Scorecard

| Criterion | Target | How to Measure |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| AI Pattern Count | 0-2 em dashes, 0 cliches | Manual count |
| Value Density | Every paragraph teaches | Self-review |
| Mobile Readability | 2-3 sentences/paragraph | Visual check |
| Competitive Edge | Better than top 3 competitors | Side-by-side compare |
| Emotional Resonance | Opening creates feeling | Read aloud |
| Compliance | All disclaimers present | Checklist |
| CTA Clarity | Reader knows exactly what to do | Fresh eyes test |

### 12.2 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Industry Average |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Click-Through Rate | 1.5%+ | 0.5-2% |
| Conversion Rate | 3.5%+ | 2-5% |
| Bounce Rate | <40% | 40-60% |
| Time on Page | 2+ minutes | Varies |
| Scroll Depth | 75%+ | 50% |

### 12.3 When Copy Fails

**If CTR is low:** Headline problem. Test new headlines.

**If bounce is high:** Promise/delivery mismatch. Check landing page alignment.

**If conversion is low:** Offer or CTA problem. Check value proposition.

**If time on page is low:** Content not engaging. Check value density and structure.
