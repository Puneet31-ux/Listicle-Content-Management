Passes 1-2 run together during drafting (Structure + Value)\n2. Pass 3 goes deep on AI pattern removal\n3. PAUSE for user preview\n4. Passes 4-7 only run if user wants more polish\n\n**Automatic Behavior:**\n- Light checks apply to all copy/content automatically\n- Say 'skip copy checks' to pause\n- Say 'full copy review' for deep analysis\n\n**Self-Healing:**\n- Every feedback session captures VALUE LESSONS\n- Lessons are logged with dates in SELF_HEALING.md\n- System gets better with each use\n\n### The 7 Passes (Quick Reference)\n1. **Structure** - All sections present, logical flow\n2. **Value** - Every paragraph teaches something\n3. **AI Patterns** - Em dashes, cliches, robotic tone\n4. **Human Voice** - Sounds like a person talking\n5. **Competitive** - Better than alternatives\n6. **Emotional** - Creates feeling, motivates\n7. **Mobile** - Scannable, short paragraphs\n\n### AI Patterns to Avoid\n- Em dashes: Max 2 per piece\n- Never: 'it's important to note', 'in conclusion', 'let's dive in'\n- Watch: excessive hedging, parallel structure overuse\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Try `/copy-write` to generate new copy\n2. Use `/copy-check` on existing content\n3. Give feedback via `/copy-feedback` to improve the system\n4. System auto-heals and gets better over time\n\n### Files Location\n.claude/skills/master-copywriting/\n- SKILL.md (main workflow)\n- GLOBAL_BEHAVIOR.md (throttling rules)\n- SELF_HEALING.md (feedback log + improvements)\n- references/ (formulas, patterns, psychology)\n- workflows/ (listicle-specific, etc.)"
