description: Master copywriting skill for creating high-converting, human-sounding copy. Uses iterative healing passes, removes AI patterns, and ensures competitive advantage. Read MASTER_COPYWRITING_SYSTEM.md first.

<essential_context>
## Before You Do Anything

**Read the full system:** `.claude/docs/MASTER_COPYWRITING_SYSTEM.md`

This skill is the execution layer. The system document is the knowledge layer. You need both.

**Core truth:** Great copy is never written in one pass. It's healed through multiple focused checks, each looking for ONE thing.
</essential_context>

<why_order_matters>
## The Sequence is Not Optional

Every step in this skill exists in a specific order because that order was discovered through iteration.

1. **Research first** - Writing without research produces generic copy
2. **Draft second** - Get something down, ugly is fine
3. **Multiple passes** - Each pass looks for ONE thing
4. **Check against competitors** - We must be better, not just different
5. **Final human check** - Read aloud, does it sound like a person?

**Skipping steps costs more time than it saves.** The "quick" approach produces copy that fails to convert, requiring rewrites anyway.

## What Copy Are We Creating?

Before proceeding, I need to understand:

1. **Copy Type:**
   - [ ] Listicle (comparison content with offers)
   - [ ] Blog post (informational content)
   - [ ] Ad copy (headlines, descriptions, CTAs)
   - [ ] Email (subject lines, body, CTAs)
   - [ ] Landing page (full page copy)

2. **Topic/Offer:**
   - What are we writing about?
   - What product/service/offer is involved?

3. **Target Audience:**
   - Who is reading this?
   - What's their pain point?
   - What have they already tried?

4. **Existing Materials:**
   - Do you have analysis/research already completed?
   - Are there competitor examples to reference?
   - Is there a landing page this connects to?

**Once I have this context, I'll proceed with the appropriate workflow.**

<workflow_router>
## Workflow Selection

Based on copy type:

| Copy Type | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| Listicle | workflows/write-listicle-copy.md |
| Blog | workflows/write-blog-copy.md |
| Ad Copy | workflows/write-ad-copy.md |
| Email | workflows/write-email-copy.md |
| Landing Page | workflows/write-landing-page-copy.md |

**All workflows follow the same core process:**
1. Research Phase
2. Draft Phase
3. Seven-Pass Review
4. Competitive Check
5. Final Polish
</workflow_router>

<research_phase>
## Phase 1: Research (NEVER SKIP)

### Competitive Research
Before writing ANY copy:

1. **Find 10+ competitor examples**
   - Search for similar content/ads/offers
   - Screenshot and save
   - Note what's working

2. **Analyze their approach:**
   - What pain points targeted?
   - What promises made?
   - What CTA language used?
   - What's their emotional temperature?

3. **Identify our edge:**
   - What are they NOT saying?
   - Where are they vague where we can be specific?
   - What claims can we beat?

4. **Document 3-5 specific advantages**
   - These MUST appear in our copy

### Audience Research
If not already provided:

1. **Capture exact language**
   - What words do they use?
   - What questions are they asking?
   - What phrases appear in reviews/forums?

2. **Identify emotional drivers**
   - What keeps them up at night?
   - What do they secretly want?
   - What are they afraid of?

**Research output required before proceeding to draft.**
</research_phase>

<draft_phase>
## Phase 2: First Draft

**Goal:** Get something on paper. Ugly is fine.

### Structure First
Based on copy type, ensure all required sections:

**Listicle Structure:**
- Hook opening
- Value summary
- Qualification section
- Comparison content
- Offer placements (3-4)
- Interactive CTAs
- Clear next steps

**Blog Structure:**
- Introduction (problem acknowledgment)
- Main content sections (H2/H3)
- Offer integrations
- Conclusion with next steps

**Ad Copy Structure:**
- Headline (multiple variations)
- Description/subtext
- CTA

### Write Fast, Edit Slow
- Don't self-edit during drafting
- Get the structure complete
- Include all required sections
- Details and polish come in passes

**Draft complete → Move to passes**
</draft_phase>

<seven_passes>
## Phase 3: The Seven-Pass Review

**Each pass looks for ONE thing. Do not combine passes.**

### Pass 1: Structure Check
- [ ] All required sections present?
- [ ] Logical flow section to section?
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy?
- [ ] Visual breaks where needed?

**Fix any structure issues before proceeding.**

### Pass 2: Value Check
- [ ] Does each paragraph teach something?
- [ ] Is actionable advice included?
- [ ] Are specifics given (not vague)?
- [ ] Would reader learn something useful?

**Remove or rewrite paragraphs that fail.**

### Pass 3: AI Pattern Check

**Hard count these:**
- Em dashes (—): _____ (MAX: 2 for entire piece)
- "It's important to note": _____ (MUST BE: 0)
- "In conclusion": _____ (MUST BE: 0)
- "comprehensive": _____ (REDUCE)
- "leverage": _____ (REPLACE)

**Check for:**
- [ ] Excessive hedging (might, could, may in every sentence)
- [ ] Repetitive sentence starts
- [ ] Parallel structure overuse
- [ ] Generic phrases that say nothing

**Replace all AI patterns before proceeding.**

### Pass 4: Human Voice Check
- [ ] Read the ENTIRE piece out loud
- [ ] Does it sound like a person talking?
- [ ] Are contractions used where natural?
- [ ] Is tone conversational, not corporate?
- [ ] Would a friend send this in an email?

**Mark specific sentences that sound robotic. Rewrite them.**

### Pass 5: Competitive Check
- [ ] Pull up 3 competitor examples
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison with our copy
- [ ] Is ours more specific?
- [ ] Is ours more valuable?
- [ ] Are we saying something they're not?
- [ ] Are our claims stronger (and supportable)?

**If we're not clearly better, identify what to improve.**

### Pass 6: Emotional Check
- [ ] Does opening create feeling?
- [ ] Are pain points acknowledged?
- [ ] Is there hope/aspiration?
- [ ] Does CTA feel motivating, not pushy?
- [ ] Would this move someone to act?

**Strengthen emotional resonance where weak.**

### Pass 7: Mobile Check
- [ ] View on actual phone (or simulate)
- [ ] Is it scannable in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Are paragraphs short enough?
- [ ] Are CTAs visible without scrolling forever?
- [ ] Does it load quickly?

**Fix mobile issues before finalizing.**
</seven_passes>

<final_check>
## Phase 4: Final Quality Check

### Compliance Verification
- [ ] Required disclaimers present
- [ ] Claims substantiated
- [ ] No absolute guarantees
- [ ] Advertiser disclosure (if applicable)

### Landing Page Alignment (if applicable)
- [ ] Headline matches/reflects LP
- [ ] Offer matches LP offer
- [ ] Pricing consistent
- [ ] CTA leads to correct action

### Final Read
One more full read, asking:
- Would I click this?
- Does this help the reader?
- Is this better than what competitors have?
- Would I be proud to have my name on this?

**If any answer is "no" → Identify specific issue and fix.**
</final_check>

<output_format>
## Deliverable Format

For each piece of copy, provide:

### The Copy
Full, ready-to-use copy with all sections.

### Pass Notes
Brief summary of what was caught/fixed in each pass.

### Competitive Positioning
How this copy beats specific competitors.

### Metrics to Track
What to measure to know if it's working.

### Iteration Recommendations
What to test/improve in future versions.
</output_format>

<anti_patterns>
## What NOT to Do

**DO NOT:**
- Write without researching competitors first
- Try to fix everything in one pass
- Skip the read-aloud human voice check
- Use "Learn More" as a CTA (be specific)
- Leave AI patterns hoping no one notices
- Stop at first draft and call it done
- Combine multiple passes into one

**These shortcuts produce copy that fails. Every time.**
</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>
## How to Know You're Done

Copy is complete when:

- [ ] Competitive research completed and documented
- [ ] All seven passes completed (not combined)
- [ ] Em dash count ≤ 2
- [ ] Zero AI cliche phrases
- [ ] Read aloud sounds natural
- [ ] Better than top 3 competitor examples
- [ ] All compliance requirements met
- [ ] Mobile-tested and scannable

**If any box is unchecked, you're not done.**
