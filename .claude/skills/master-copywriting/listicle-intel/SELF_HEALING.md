## Cross-Skill Propagation Rules

### Propagate to Master-Copywriting When:
- Lesson applies to ALL copy types (not just listicles)
- CTA patterns work universally
- Psychology triggers are general

### Propagate to Specific Offer Type When:
- Lesson is category-specific
- Pattern only works for that offer type
- Competitor intel is offer-specific

### Keep in Listicle-Intel Only When:
- Research methodology issue
- Brightdata-specific problem
- Storage/organization issue
