## How This Connects to Offers

When writing a **HELOC listicle for seniors**:
1. Load `senior-listicles/patterns.md` (audience patterns)
2. Load `senior-listicles/sub-offers/heloc.md` (offer-specific)
3. Combine for copy that speaks to seniors about HELOC specifically

This layered approach means:
- Senior patterns apply to ALL senior offers
- Offer-specific patterns layer on top
- No duplication, maximum reuse
