## Gaps We Can Exploit

1. **Personalization** - None ask "what do you spend on?" to prioritize
2. **Calculator** - No "how much could you save?" tools
3. **Local focus** - Most are national, local discounts underserved
4. **Verification dates** - Many list discounts that may be discontinued
5. **Mobile experience** - Some still desktop-first

## Applying to Offer-Specific Listicles

When writing a **HELOC for seniors** listicle:
- Use headline patterns above (year, numbers, benefit)
- Use empathy opening (rising costs, fixed income)
- Add HELOC-specific content (see sub-offers/heloc.md)
- Use soft CTAs first, then qualification CTA
- Include trust signals (BBB, years in business)
