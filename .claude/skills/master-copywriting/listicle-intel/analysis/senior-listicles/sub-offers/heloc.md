### Psychology for HELOC + Seniors

**Core Emotional Drivers:**

1. **Security** - "It's YOUR equity, you earned it"
2. **Independence** - "Stay in your home on your terms"
3. **Control** - "You decide how much, when, and for what"
4. **Legacy** - "Your home, your choice about its value"

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response Angle |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I'll lose my home" | "You stay on the title. This isn't a reverse mortgage." |
| "Interest rates are high" | "Rates vary. Compare to see your actual options." |
| "It's too complicated" | "Simple process, often online. Takes minutes to check." |
| "I don't want debt" | "It's your equity - money you already have in your home." |
| "What if I can't pay?" | "Flexible payment options. Only borrow what you need." |
