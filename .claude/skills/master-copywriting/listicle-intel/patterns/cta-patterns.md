## Core Principle

**NEVER USE:**

- "Click Here"
- "Submit"
- "Continue"

**ALWAYS USE:**
- Action-specific language
- Benefit-driven text
- Low-friction framing

## CTA Pattern Categories

### 1. Quote/Estimate CTAs
```
Get My Free Quote

### 2. Comparison CTAs
```

### 3. Discovery CTAs
```

### 4. Urgency CTAs

Get Started Today
Reserve My Spot

```

**Best For:** Time-sensitive offers, scarcity situations
**Why It Works:** Creates action momentum, implies limited availability
