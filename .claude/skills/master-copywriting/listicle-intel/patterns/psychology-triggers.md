## Core Triggers by Stage

### Awareness Stage Triggers

#### 1. Problem Recognition
```
"If you're [experiencing pain point], you're not alone..."
"Most people don't realize [hidden cost/risk]..."
"The [industry] doesn't want you to know..."
```
**Why It Works:** Validates experience, creates "aha" moment

#### 2. Curiosity Gap
```
"There's a reason why [surprising fact]..."
"What [successful group] knows that you don't..."
"The [X] thing most [audience] overlook..."
```
**Why It Works:** Creates information asymmetry, drives scroll

---

### Consideration Stage Triggers

#### 3. Social Proof
```
"[X]+ people have already [taken action]"
"Rated [score] by [authority/review source]"
"[Testimonial from relatable person]"
```
**Why It Works:** Reduces perceived risk, herd behavior

#### 4. Authority
```
"According to [expert/institution]..."
"[Credential holder] recommends..."
"Industry standards require..."
```
**Why It Works:** Borrowed credibility, expertise heuristic

#### 5. Comparison Anchoring
```
Show worst option first → middle options → best option
Present "most popular" prominently
Use "compared to [expensive alternative]"
```
**Why It Works:** Creates reference points, guides decision

---

### Decision Stage Triggers

#### 6. Loss Aversion
```
"Don't miss out on [benefit]"
"Others are already saving [amount]"
"Rates won't stay this low"
```
**Why It Works:** Losses feel 2x stronger than equivalent gains

#### 7. Scarcity
```
"Limited time offer"
"Only [X] spots available"
"Offer expires [date]"
```
**Why It Works:** Urgency increases action velocity
**Use Ethically:** Only when scarcity is real

#### 8. Friction Reduction
```
"Takes less than [X] minutes"
"No credit check required"
"100% free, no obligation"
"Cancel anytime"
```
**Why It Works:** Removes perceived barriers

```

**Authority + Friction Reduction:**
```
"Expert-recommended option. Check eligibility in 60 seconds."
```

**Loss Aversion + Comparison:**
```
"Don't pay more than you need to. See how your current [service] compares."
```

**Curiosity + Problem Recognition:**
```
"The [X] reason your [attempt] isn't working - and what to do instead."
```
