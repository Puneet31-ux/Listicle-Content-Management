# AI Pattern Removal Reference

## Why This Matters

AI-generated copy has tells. Readers sense it. Google penalizes it. Competitors beat it.

Human-sounding copy builds trust. Trust converts.

**This is not about hiding that AI helped. It's about producing copy that sounds like a person wrote it because it was actually refined by a person (or an AI acting like a good editor).**

---

## The Hard Rules

### Rule 1: Em Dashes (—)

**Maximum:** 1-2 per entire piece. Preferably zero.

**Why:** Em dashes are the #1 AI giveaway. AI overuses them dramatically. Humans rarely use em dashes in casual writing.

**How to fix:**
- Replace with period and new sentence
- Replace with comma if appropriate
- Rewrite to eliminate need for pause

**Before:**
> "The provider offers three options—basic, premium, and enterprise—each with different features."

**After:**
> "The provider offers three options: basic, premium, and enterprise. Each has different features."

---

### Rule 2: Cliche Phrases (ZERO TOLERANCE)

These phrases must NEVER appear:

| Phrase | Why It's Bad | Replacement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| "It's important to note" | Filler that adds nothing | Just state the thing |
| "In conclusion" | Signals AI structure | Drop it, ending speaks for itself |
| "Let's dive in" | Overused opener | Just start |
| "At the end of the day" | Meaningless filler | Delete, rewrite |
| "In order to" | Wordy | "To" |
| "Comprehensive guide" | AI loves this | "Guide" or "This guide" |
| "Leverage" (as verb) | Corporate jargon | "Use" |
| "Utilize" | Pretentious | "Use" |
| "First and foremost" | Redundant | "First" or delete |
| "In today's world" | Vague filler | Be specific or delete |
| "It goes without saying" | Then don't say it | Delete |
| "Needless to say" | Then don't say it | Delete |
| "Make no mistake" | Empty emphasis | Delete |
| "The fact of the matter is" | Wordy filler | Delete |
| "At this point in time" | Wordy | "Now" |
| "Due to the fact that" | Wordy | "Because" |

---

### Rule 3: Hedging Overuse

**Problem:** AI hedges constantly with "might," "could," "may," "potentially," "possibly" because it's trained to be cautious.

**Result:** Copy sounds uncertain and weak.

**How to fix:**
- Ask: Is this actually uncertain?
- If yes: One hedge per paragraph max
- If no: State it confidently

**Before:**
> "You might want to consider comparing providers, as this could potentially help you save money and may lead to better outcomes."

**After:**
> "Compare providers. You'll save money and get better outcomes."

---

### Rule 4: Repetitive Sentence Starts

**Problem:** AI often starts multiple sentences the same way, especially with:
- "You can..."
- "This is..."
- "It's..."
- "The [noun]..."

**How to fix:**
- Vary sentence beginnings
- Start with different parts of speech
- Use questions, commands, fragments

**Before:**
> "You can compare prices online. You can check reviews. You can verify credentials. You can contact providers directly."

**After:**
> "Compare prices online. Check reviews. Verify credentials. Contact providers directly to ask questions."

---

### Rule 5: Parallel Structure Overuse

**Problem:** AI loves parallel structure (X, Y, and Z pattern). Humans use it sometimes; AI uses it constantly.

**How to fix:**
- Break parallel structures occasionally
- Vary list formats
- Use different sentence types

**Before:**
> "Our providers are licensed, experienced, and dedicated. Our platform is fast, reliable, and secure. Our support is responsive, helpful, and available."

**After:**
> "Our providers are licensed professionals with years of experience. The platform runs fast without security compromises. Support responds quickly, actually helps, and works around your schedule."

---

### Rule 6: Abstract → Concrete → Abstract Pattern

**Problem:** AI often structures paragraphs as:
1. Abstract statement
2. Concrete example
3. Abstract conclusion

This creates a predictable rhythm that feels mechanical.

**How to fix:**
- Vary paragraph structures
- Sometimes start concrete
- Sometimes skip the conclusion restatement

**Before:**
> "Finding the right provider is important. For example, a provider with good reviews and transparent pricing can save you money. That's why choosing carefully matters."

**After:**
> "Check reviews. Look at pricing. A provider with good ratings and clear costs saves you hundreds compared to one that hides fees."

## The Detection Process

### Automated Check

Search for these in your copy:

```
Phrase to search    | Max allowed
--------------------|------------
—                   | 2
important to note   | 0
in conclusion       | 0
let's dive          | 0
at the end of the day | 0
comprehensive       | 1
leverage            | 0
utilize             | 0
needless to say     | 0
```

### Manual Check

Read the piece and ask:

1. **Would I send this to a friend?**
   - If no, it's too formal/robotic

2. **Does any sentence make me cringe?**
   - Mark it, rewrite it

3. **Are there three sentences in a row starting the same way?**
   - Fix the pattern

4. **Does any paragraph feel like a textbook?**
   - Make it conversational

5. **Is there a phrase I would never say out loud?**
   - Rewrite it

## Replacement Strategies

### For Formal → Conversational

| Formal | Conversational |
|--------|----------------|
| "It is recommended that you" | "You should" or just imperative |
| "One might consider" | "Consider" |
| "There are several factors" | "A few things matter here" |
| "It should be noted that" | Just say the thing |
| "Prior to" | "Before" |
| "Subsequently" | "Then" or "After" |
| "Additionally" | "Also" or just start new thought |
| "Furthermore" | "And" or just continue |
| "However" (overused) | "But" or restructure |
| "Therefore" | "So" |
| "Consequently" | Drop it, just state the result |

### For Wordy → Concise

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| "in order to" | "to" |
| "due to the fact that" | "because" |
| "at this point in time" | "now" |
| "in the event that" | "if" |
| "for the purpose of" | "to" or "for" |
| "in spite of the fact that" | "although" |
| "with regard to" | "about" |
| "in close proximity to" | "near" |
| "is able to" | "can" |
| "has the ability to" | "can" |

### For Passive → Active

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "It is believed that" | "[Someone] believes" |
| "The decision was made" | "[Who] decided" |
| "Mistakes were made" | "We made mistakes" |
| "It was found that" | "We found" |
| "Services are provided" | "We provide" or "[Company] provides" |

## The Read-Aloud Test

**This is non-negotiable.**

Read your copy out loud. All of it.

**What to listen for:**
- Tongue twisters (rewrite for flow)
- Sentences that need a breath (too long)
- Words you stumble on (wrong word choice)
- Phrases that sound weird spoken (too formal)
- Repetitive rhythms (AI pattern)

**If you wouldn't say it in conversation, rewrite it.**

## Examples: Before and After

### Example 1: Opening Paragraph

**AI-Generated:**
> "In today's competitive landscape, it's important to note that choosing the right provider can be a daunting task. There are numerous factors to consider—from pricing to reputation to support—and making the wrong choice could potentially cost you thousands of dollars. Let's dive into everything you need to know."

**Human-Sounding:**
> "Choosing a provider is confusing. There are dozens of options, pricing that makes no sense, and reviews that contradict each other. This guide breaks it down so you can pick the right one without wasting hours or money."

**What changed:**
- Removed "In today's competitive landscape" (meaningless)
- Removed "it's important to note" (filler)
- Removed em dash (AI tell)
- Removed "potentially" (weak hedge)
- Removed "Let's dive into" (cliche)
- Made specific problems concrete
- Promised value directly

### Example 2: Feature Description

**AI-Generated:**
> "Our platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help you compare providers effectively. These tools include—but are not limited to—pricing comparisons, review aggregation, and eligibility verification. It is recommended that users utilize these features to make an informed decision."

**Human-Sounding:**
> "Compare prices, read reviews, and check if you qualify. All in one place. Use it before you commit to anything."

**What changed:**
- Removed "comprehensive suite of tools" (corporate jargon)
- Removed em dash with "but are not limited to" (AI tell + legal-speak)
- Removed "It is recommended that users" (passive, formal)
- Removed "utilize" (pretentious)
- Made it action-oriented and direct

### Example 3: CTA Section

**AI-Generated:**
> "In conclusion, taking the time to compare providers can lead to significant savings and better outcomes. By leveraging the information provided in this guide, you can make a decision that's right for your unique situation. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions—we're here to help!"

**Human-Sounding:**
> "Compare your options. Pick the one that fits. Save money and get better results. Questions? Ask us."

**What changed:**
- Removed "In conclusion" (AI tell)
- Removed "leveraging" (corporate jargon)
- Removed "unique situation" (vague)
- Removed "Don't hesitate to" (filler)
- Removed em dash (AI tell)
- Made it direct commands
- Shortened dramatically
