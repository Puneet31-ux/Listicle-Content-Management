# CTA Patterns Reference

## Why CTAs Matter

A great piece of copy with a weak CTA is a missed opportunity. The CTA is where intention becomes action.

**The goal:** Make the next step obvious, easy, and desirable.

## CTA Types

### 1. Action-Oriented CTAs

**How it works:** Tell them exactly what to do. Clear, direct, imperative.

**Formulas:**
- "[Action] Now"
- "[Action] [Object]"
- "Get [Started/Access/Your]"
- "Start [Action]"
- "[Action] Today"

**Examples:**
- "Compare Providers Now"
- "Check Your Eligibility"
- "Get Your Free Quote"
- "Start Comparing"
- "Find Your Match Today"

**Best for:** When the action is clear and understood.

---

### 2. Benefit-Included CTAs

**How it works:** Include what they'll get, not just what they'll do.

**Formulas:**
- "[Action] + [Benefit]"
- "Get [Benefit]"
- "See [Benefit]"
- "Find [Result]"
- "[Action] to [Benefit]"

**Examples:**
- "Compare Providers Free"
- "Get Your Savings Estimate"
- "See Your Options"
- "Find Your Perfect Match"
- "Start Saving Today"

**Best for:** When the benefit reinforces motivation.

---

### 3. Urgency CTAs

**How it works:** Add time pressure or scarcity to motivate immediate action.

**Formulas:**
- "[Action] Before [Deadline]"
- "[Action] - [Scarcity]"
- "Claim [Offer] Now"
- "Don't Miss [Benefit]"
- "[Action] While [Available]"

**Examples:**
- "Compare Before Prices Change"
- "Check Eligibility - Limited Spots"
- "Claim Your $120 OFF Now"

- "Start While Offer Lasts"

**Warning:** Only use real urgency. Fake scarcity destroys trust.

**Best for:** Time-limited offers, genuine scarcity.

---

### 4. Low-Friction CTAs

**How it works:** Remove barriers by emphasizing what's NOT required.

**Formulas:**
- "[Action] - No [Barrier]"

- "Just [Simple Action]"

**Examples:**

- "Get Results in 60 Seconds"
- "Just Enter Your ZIP"

**Best for:** Cold audiences, first-time visitors, high-value offers.

---

### 5. Interactive CTAs

**How it works:** Give them something to DO, not just click. Creates psychological investment.

**Types:**

**Selector CTAs:**
- "Select Your [Amount/Type/Situation]"

## CTA Placement Strategy

### Where to Place CTAs

**1. After Explaining Criteria**
Reader just learned what matters. Show them how to apply it.

*Example: After "5 Things to Check Before Choosing"*
> "Ready to check these boxes? Compare providers now."

**2. After Emotional Peak**
When reader is most motivated, make action easy.

*Example: After a powerful testimonial*
> "Join thousands who made this choice. Get started."

**3. After Objection Handling**
Concerns resolved, barriers lowered.

*Example: After explaining safety/legitimacy*
> "Verified providers, transparent pricing. See your options."

**4. At Natural Decision Points**
Where the content naturally leads to a choice.

*Example: After comparing options*
> "Found your match? Check eligibility now."

**5. At the End**
For those who read everything before acting.

*Example: Final summary*
> "You have the information. Now take the next step."

### How Many CTAs?

**Minimum:** 2-3 throughout content + 1 at end
**For listicles:** 3-4 strategic placements
**Maximum:** Don't spam. Each CTA should feel natural.

**Rule:** Readers don't always finish. Give them opportunities to act throughout.

## CTA Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Button CTAs** for primary actions
- **Text CTAs** for secondary options
- **One primary CTA per view** (don't compete with yourself)

### Color & Contrast

- Primary CTA should visually stand out
- Use brand accent color
- Sufficient contrast for readability
- Test on mobile

### Size & Spacing

- Large enough to tap on mobile
- Adequate whitespace around CTA
- Not buried in text
- Clear visual separation

---

## Subtext & Risk Reversal

### What Goes Below the CTA

The text below the button addresses final objections:

**Formulas:**
- "No [barrier] required"
- "Free for [time/forever]"
- "[Reassurance about concern]"
- "[Number] have already [action]"
- "Takes only [time]"

**Examples:**
- "No credit card required"
- "Free forever - no hidden fees"
- "Won't affect your credit score"
- "100,000+ have already compared"
- "Takes less than 2 minutes"

### Common Objections to Address

| Objection | Subtext Solution |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Will this cost money?" | "100% Free" |
| "Will I get spammed?" | "No spam. Ever." |
| "Is this legit?" | "[Authority] verified" |
| "Will this take forever?" | "60 seconds" |
| "Will this hurt my credit?" | "No impact on credit score" |
| "Am I committing to anything?" | "No obligation" |
