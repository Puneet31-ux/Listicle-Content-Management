## Headline Testing Framework

### Never Launch With One Headline

Create 5 variations minimum:
1. Question format
2. Benefit format
3. Number format
4. Social proof format
5. Problem format

Test and let data decide.

### Testing Variables

When A/B testing headlines, change ONE thing at a time:

- **Format:** Question vs Statement
- **Length:** Short vs Long
- **Specificity:** Vague vs Specific
- **Emotion:** Calm vs Urgent
- **Numbers:** With vs Without

### Success Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| CTR | Headline is compelling |
| Bounce Rate | Headline matches content |
| Time on Page | Headline attracted right audience |
| Conversion | Full funnel is working |

High CTR + High Bounce = Headline overpromised
Low CTR = Headline not compelling enough

## Headline Audit Checklist

Before publishing any headline:

- [ ] Does it promise a specific benefit?
- [ ] Would target audience recognize themselves?
- [ ] Is it clear what they'll get by clicking?
- [ ] Does it avoid AI-sounding cliches?
- [ ] Is it within optimal length for platform?
- [ ] Have I created 5+ variations to test?
- [ ] Does it match the content that follows?
- [ ] Would I click this if I saw it?

## Examples: Weak vs Strong

### Weak Headlines (and why)

| Headline | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| "The Ultimate Guide to Finding Providers" | Vague, overused "ultimate" |
| "Everything You Need to Know" | Says nothing specific |
| "A Comprehensive Look at Options" | AI-sounding, no benefit |
| "Important Information About Healthcare" | Boring, no hook |
| "Read This Before Making a Decision" | Vague threat, no value |

### Strong Headlines (and why)

| Headline | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| "Stop Overpaying: 8 Providers Compared" | Problem + Number + Specificity |
| "Save $500+/Month (Here's How)" | Benefit + Curiosity |
| "Are You Making These 3 Costly Mistakes?" | Question + Number + Loss Aversion |
| "Join 100,000+ Who Found Better Pricing" | Social Proof + Benefit |
| "5-Minute Comparison Could Save You Thousands" | Time + Benefit + Anchor |
