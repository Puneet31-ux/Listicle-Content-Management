# Psychology Triggers Reference

## Why This Matters

These are not tricks. These are documented patterns of how humans make decisions.

Using them ethically means helping readers make better decisions. Using them unethically means manipulating people into bad ones.

**The difference:** Does this copy help the reader get what they actually need, or does it pressure them into something they'll regret?

## The Six Core Triggers

### 1. Loss Aversion

**The science:** People feel losses roughly twice as strongly as equivalent gains. A $100 loss hurts more than a $100 gain feels good.

**Application in copy:**
- Frame benefits as avoiding loss rather than achieving gain
- Highlight what they're currently losing (money, time, peace of mind)
- Show the cost of inaction

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Don't miss [opportunity]" | "Don't miss out on $500+ savings" |
| "Stop [losing/wasting]" | "Stop overpaying by $300/month" |
| "Avoid [negative outcome]" | "Avoid the hidden fees that cost most buyers thousands" |
| "Before [deadline], [consequence]" | "Before rates increase, lock in this price" |

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Save $500" (gain framing, less powerful)
- "Get better pricing" (vague, no loss reference)

**Ethical check:** Is there actually something to lose, or are we manufacturing fear?

---

### 2. Social Proof

**The science:** Humans look to others' behavior when making decisions, especially under uncertainty. "If others chose this, it must be good."

**Application in copy:**
- Show numbers of people who chose/succeeded
- Display specific results people achieved
- Use testimonials with identifiable details

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "[Number]+ [audience] [result]" | "Join 100,000+ patients who found affordable treatment" |
| "[Percentage]% [success metric]" | "93% report significant improvement in 30 days" |
| "Average [specific result]" | "Average savings of $847/month" |
| "[Type of person] like [you]" | "Busy professionals like you save 3 hours per week" |

**Requirements:**
- Numbers must be specific (not "thousands")
- Results must be measurable (not "felt better")
- Audience must be identifiable (not just "people")
- Claims must be true and verifiable

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Many people use our service" (vague)
- "Customers love us" (unquantified)

**Ethical check:** Are these real results from real people, or manufactured statistics?

---

### 3. Scarcity & Urgency

**The science:** Limited availability increases perceived value. When something might not be available, we want it more.

**Application in copy:**
- Highlight genuine limited availability
- Show real deadlines
- Indicate when inventory/spots are low

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "[Limited resource] - [action]" | "Limited spots available - check your eligibility" |
| "Only [number] [resource] left" | "Only 3 consultation slots left this week" |
| "[Time limit] - [benefit]" | "Price guaranteed until Friday" |
| "Ending [specific date]" | "Offer expires December 15" |

**WARNING: Fake scarcity destroys trust.**

If the "limited time offer" runs forever, readers learn you're dishonest. If spots are "almost gone" but never actually run out, you lose credibility permanently.

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Limited time offer" (overused, often fake)
- "Act now" (empty urgency)

**Ethical check:** Is this deadline/scarcity real, or are we manufacturing pressure?

---

### 4. Authority & Trust

**The science:** People defer to experts and trust credentials. We follow the advice of those we perceive as knowledgeable.

**Application in copy:**
- Display relevant credentials and certifications
- Show industry recognition
- Reference regulatory approvals
- Highlight experience and expertise

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "[Credential] [professionals]" | "US Board-Certified Physicians" |
| "[Regulatory body]-approved" | "FDA-approved medications" |
| "Licensed [authority]" | "Licensed in all 50 states" |
| "[Number] years [experience]" | "15 years of specialized experience" |
| "Recommended by [authority]" | "Recommended by leading healthcare publications" |

**Requirements:**
- Credentials must be verifiable
- Authority must be relevant to the topic
- Specific is better than vague

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Trusted experts" (vague, unverifiable)
- "Industry-leading" (meaningless)

**Ethical check:** Are these credentials real and relevant, or are we borrowing authority we don't have?

---

### 5. Reciprocity

**The science:** When someone gives us something, we feel obligated to give back. This is deeply wired in human psychology.

**Application in copy:**
- Offer genuine value upfront
- Give before asking
- Make the gift actually useful

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Free [valuable resource]" | "Free comparison guide - no email required" |
| "[Amount] OFF [first purchase]" | "$120 OFF your first month" |
| "No [barrier] required" | "No credit card required to see your options" |
| "[Free thing] - [no strings]" | "Free consultation - no obligation to continue" |

**Key:** The gift must be genuinely valuable. A worthless "free guide" triggers no reciprocity.

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Free trial" (too common, low perceived value)
- "Download now" (no clear value statement)

**Ethical check:** Is this gift actually valuable, or are we pretending to give while taking (email addresses, attention)?

---

### 6. Anchoring

**The science:** The first number we see influences our perception of all subsequent numbers. A $1,000 price seems reasonable if we first saw $5,000.

**Application in copy:**
- Show the higher price/cost first
- Compare to more expensive alternatives
- Display "was/now" pricing

**Formulas:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "[Low price] vs. [high price]" | "$179/month vs. $1,400 at retail pharmacies" |
| "Save up to [amount] vs. [alternative]" | "Save up to $1,000/month compared to brand-name" |
| "Starting at [price] (compare to [higher])" | "Starting at $99 (most competitors charge $300+)" |
| "Was [higher], now [lower]" | "Was $500, now $199" |

**Requirements:**
- Anchor must be believable
- Comparison must be fair (same product/service)
- Claims must be accurate

**Weaker alternatives (avoid):**
- "Affordable pricing" (no anchor, no comparison)
- "Great value" (vague, no numbers)

**Ethical check:** Is the anchor a real price people actually pay, or are we inventing an inflated comparison?

## Combining Triggers

**Powerful copy often combines 2-3 triggers:**

**Loss Aversion + Social Proof:**
> "Don't join the 67% who overpay by $300+/month. See what smart buyers choose instead."

**Scarcity + Authority:**
> "Board-certified physicians have 3 openings left this week. Book before they fill."

**Anchoring + Reciprocity:**
> "Others pay $1,400/month. Get our free comparison that shows $179/month alternatives."

**Social Proof + Urgency:**
> "100,000+ patients saved last year. Current promotion ends Friday."

## Ethical Guidelines

### The Test

Before using any trigger, ask:

1. **Is the underlying claim true?**
   - Real scarcity? Real credentials? Real statistics?

2. **Does this help the reader make a better decision?**
   - Or are we pressuring them into something they don't need?

3. **Would I feel good if my family clicked this?**
   - Would I recommend this to someone I care about?

4. **Can we deliver on the promise?**
   - Does the landing page fulfill what the copy promises?

### Red Lines

**Never do these:**
- Invent fake scarcity or deadlines
- Manufacture statistics
- Claim credentials you don't have
- Create fear about non-issues
- Promise results you can't deliver
- Use high-pressure tactics on vulnerable people

### The Golden Rule

**Psychology should help readers make better decisions, not manipulate them into bad ones.**

If you're using loss aversion to warn someone about a real loss, that's helpful.
If you're manufacturing fear to pressure someone into acting fast, that's manipulation.

Know the difference.
