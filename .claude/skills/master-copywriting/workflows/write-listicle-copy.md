# Write Listicle Copy Workflow

## What This Workflow Does

Creates high-converting listicle copy from analyzed offers. Listicles are not blog posts. They are comparison machines designed to move readers from awareness to action.

**Prerequisites:**
- Offer analysis completed (or will be gathered)
- Competitive research completed (or will be conducted)
- Master copywriting system understood

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

### Required Inputs

Before writing, I need:

1. **Offer Details:**
   - What product/service are we promoting?
   - What's the main value proposition?
   - What's the pricing structure?
   - What differentiates this from competitors?

2. **Target Audience:**
   - Who is searching for this?
   - What problem are they trying to solve?
   - What have they already tried?
   - What are they afraid of?

3. **Category:**
   - Financial (debt, loans, credit, insurance)
   - Home Services (roofing, HVAC, solar)
   - Health & Wellness (treatments, supplements)
   - Technology (software, devices)
   - Education (courses, certifications)
   - Other: specify

4. **Landing Page:**
   - URL of destination page
   - Key promises on that page
   - CTA on that page

**If analysis exists in conversation → Extract it**
**If analysis doesn't exist → Gather through questions**

## Phase 2: Competitive Research

### Research Protocol

**Step 1: Find 10+ competitor listicles**
- Search: "[category] comparison"
- Search: "best [category] providers"
- Search: "[category] reviews"
- Save URLs and screenshots

**Step 2: Analyze each competitor**

For each competitor, document:

| Element | What They're Doing |
|---------|-------------------|
| Headline | |
| Opening hook | |
| Structure | |
| Offer placement | |
| CTA language | |
| Interactive elements | |
| Unique claims | |

**Step 3: Identify gaps**

- What are they NOT saying that matters?
- Where are they vague?
- What trust signals are missing?
- What objections are unaddressed?

**Step 4: Document our advantages**

List 3-5 specific ways our listicle will be better:

4.
5.

## Phase 3: Draft Structure

### Required Sections

Every listicle MUST include:

**1. Hook Opening (2-4 sentences)**
- Immediately create resonance
- Pain-focused OR aspiration-focused
- Use reader's own language

**2. Value Summary (1 paragraph)**
- What will reader learn?
- Why should they keep reading?
- What's in it for them?

**3. Qualification Section**
- Who is this for?
- Who is this NOT for?
- What situations apply?

**4. Comparison Content**
- Structured, scannable format
- Real specifics (not vague features)
- Honest pros and cons
- Clear differentiators

**5. Strategic Offer Placements (3-4)**
- After criteria explanation
- After comparison sections
- After objection handling
- Final comprehensive comparison

**6. Interactive CTA Elements**
- Selector (amount, type, situation)
- Calculator
- Quiz
- ZIP entry
- NOT just "Learn More"

**7. Clear Next Steps**
- What to do now
- What happens after clicking
- Risk reversal (no obligation, free, etc.)

## Phase 4: Generate Variations

### Create 3-5 Distinct Variations

Each variation tests a different psychological approach:

**Variation 1: Pain-Focused**
- Opens with acute pain/struggle
- Agitates the problem
- Positions solution as relief

**Variation 2: Aspiration-Focused**
- Opens with desired future state
- Paints picture of life after solving
- Positions solution as path to that future

**Variation 3: Logic-Focused**
- Opens with data and math
- Clear cost comparisons
- Rational decision framework

**Variation 4: Urgency-Focused**
- Opens with consequence of inaction
- Real deadlines or scarcity
- Positions solution as time-sensitive

**Variation 5: Social Proof-Focused**
- Opens with success stories
- Numbers and statistics
- Positions solution as proven path

### For Each Variation, Include:

```
### Variation [Number]: [Name]

**Strategic Approach:**
[1-2 sentences explaining psychological angle]

**Headline:**
[Compelling headline]

**Subheadline:**
[Supporting subheadline]

**Opening Hook:**
[2-4 sentences creating resonance]

**Body Copy:**
[Main content - structured, scannable]

**Interactive CTA:**
- Element: [What reader does]
- Button: "[CTA text]"
- Subtext: [Risk reversal]

**Why This Works:**
[2-3 sentences on psychological strategy]
```
