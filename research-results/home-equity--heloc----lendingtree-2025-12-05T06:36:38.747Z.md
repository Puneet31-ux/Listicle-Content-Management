            millions of seniors

            only if you know to ask
            . With costs rising and fixed incomes stretched thin, 
            not taking advantage of these hidden savings can mean missing out on thousands of dollars each year
            .

            top senior discounts and benefits you need to claim in 2025
            —some of which could save you 
            as much as $6,100 annually
            ! But act fast: many of these special offers are 
            online-only and may vanish forever by the end of the month
