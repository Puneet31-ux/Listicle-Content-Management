## Step 4: Usage Guidance

After presenting questions, provide:

**How to Use This Analysis:**

1. **Fill out answers** - Research the service, provider, landing page, and competitors thoroughly
2. **Identify gaps** - Note which questions you can't answer (reveals unclear positioning or missing information)
3. **Map to copy elements** - Use answers to craft:
   - Hook: Current problem state + emotional pain + what if don't fix
   - Value: Service value proposition + aspirational outcomes + differentiation
   - Proof: Credentials + social proof + local connection
   - Qualification: Eligibility + property types + geographic availability
   - CTA: Personalized engagement + risk reversal + urgency
4. **Test assumptions** - If guessing on persona or psychology questions, validate with customer research
5. **Bridge continuity** - Ensure listicle promise = landing page delivery

**Red Flags:**
- Can't explain what's included vs extra → scope confusion, unhappy customers
- Can't identify specific pain points → generic copy won't resonate
- Unclear if direct provider or referral → mismatched expectations
- Landing page doesn't match listicle tone/promise → high bounce rate
- Can't articulate the tangible outcome → weak value proposition

**Service-Specific Considerations:**
- **Roofing**: Emphasize safety, damage prevention, curb appeal, insurance claims
- **HVAC**: Focus on comfort, energy savings, seasonal urgency, system age
- **Solar**: Highlight savings, ROI, environmental impact, incentives
- **Real Estate**: Stress cash offers, speed, convenience, as-is purchase
- **Remodeling**: Feature transformation, home value, lifestyle upgrade
