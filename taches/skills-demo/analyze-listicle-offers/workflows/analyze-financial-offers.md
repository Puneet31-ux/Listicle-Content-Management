## Step 1: Gather Offer Context

Ask the user to provide:
- Offer name/description
- URL to landing page (if available)
- Any existing copy or details they have
- Target audience (if known)

## Step 2: Generate Deep-Dive Analysis Questions

Present all questions in the structured framework below. Organize by category for clarity.

### CATEGORY 1: CORE OFFER MECHANICS (Questions 1-8)

**1. Value Proposition**

- What is the time frame for achieving this benefit? (immediate, 30 days, 6 months, etc.)

**2. Eligibility & Qualification**
- Who qualifies for this offer? (credit score, income level, debt amount, employment status, age, location)
- What are the MINIMUM requirements to be eligible?
- What are the MAXIMUM thresholds? (e.g., debt can't exceed $X, income must be under $X)
- Are there any disqualifying factors we must mention upfront?

**3. Process & Commitment**
- What are the exact steps from clicking the CTA to getting the benefit?
- How long does the process take? (3 minutes, same day, 24 hours, etc.)

### CATEGORY 2: READER PSYCHOLOGY & PAIN POINTS (Questions 9-20)

**9. Skepticism & Objections**
- Why would they think "this sounds too good to be true"?
- What past experiences make them skeptical? (scams, failed attempts, broken promises)
- What specific doubts will they have? (will hurt my credit, too expensive, won't work for me, just another gimmick)
- What proof do they need to believe? (testimonials, guarantees, credentials, transparent pricing)

**10. Social Proof Needs**

- What testimonial elements matter most? (specific numbers, emotional journey, unexpected benefits)
- What credentials or authority build trust? (years in business, BBB rating, licensed, certified)

**11. Comparison Frame**
- What alternatives are they considering? (other debt relief programs, DIY solutions, doing nothing, bankruptcy)
- How does this compare on key factors? (speed, cost, credit impact, success rate)

### CATEGORY 3: CTA & ENGAGEMENT MECHANICS (Questions 21-30)

**13. Personalization Opportunities**

- What detail makes them feel informed enough to make a decision?

**20. Must-Hide to Maintain Curiosity**
- What specific details should be revealed only on landing page? (exact rates, provider names, personalized calculations)
- What information revealed too early kills the click? (complicated process, lengthy requirements, extensive documentation needed)
- Where is the line between "enough to qualify myself" and "everything I need to know"?

**21. Qualification Checkpoints**
- What self-qualification happens in the listicle? ("Do I have $X debt? Yes → this might be for me")
- What final qualification happens on landing page?
- Where might mismatched expectations cause abandonment?

**22. Transparency vs Mystery**

```

## Step 4: Usage Guidance

After presenting questions, provide:

**How to Use This Analysis:**

1. **Fill out answers** - Research the offer, landing page, and competitors to answer each question thoroughly
2. **Identify gaps** - Note which questions you can't answer (this reveals missing information or unclear positioning)
3. **Map to copy elements** - Use answers to craft:
   - Opening hook (pain points + emotional triggers)
   - Value description (core mechanics + aspirational state)
   - Qualification language (eligibility + persona fit)
   - CTA design (engagement mechanics + risk reversal)
   - Information disclosure (balance + transparency)
4. **Test assumptions** - If you're guessing on persona/psychology questions, consider user research or A/B testing
5. **Bridge to landing page** - Ensure every promise in listicle is fulfilled on landing page

**Red Flags:**
- Can't answer eligibility questions → offer too vague, will cause bounces
- Can't identify specific pain points → copy will be generic and not resonate
- Can't articulate "what user is doing" in CTA → weak engagement
- Landing page doesn't match listicle promises → conversion killer
