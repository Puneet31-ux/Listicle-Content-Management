## Core Listicle Psychology

### 1. Offer-to-Reader Resonance
Successful listicles create "this is me" moments. The reader must see themselves in the offer description before they act. Analysis must identify every possible reader persona and their specific pain points.

### 2. CTA Engagement Over Generic Links
Strong CTAs activate the reader immediately (selecting debt amount, choosing location, etc.) rather than passive "learn more" links. This triggers:
- Self-reflection (how much debt DO I have?)
- Curiosity (what will happen when I click?)
- Automatic progression without conscious decision fatigue

### 3. Information Balance
Too little info → reader arrives at landing page confused/disappointed
Too much info → copy becomes overwhelming, reader never clicks

The analysis must identify the MINIMUM information needed to qualify the reader and the MAXIMUM information that maintains curiosity.

### 4. Behavioral Psychology Foundations
- **Dopamine trigger**: When readers see themselves in the story, dopamine releases, creating trust and emotional connection
- **Automatic action**: Engaged interactions (clicking personalized options) bypass rational decision-making
- **Storytelling immersion**: Readers in "character role" mode convert better than passive observers

### 5. Conversion = Sale, Not Click
Success is measured at offer conversion (form fill, survey, purchase), not listicle click. Analysis must trace the full journey from listicle → landing page → conversion.

### 6. Intelligent Multi-Source Analysis with Quick-Answer Format
Not all questions apply to all offers. The skill must:
- **Analyze multiple sources**: Read the landing page AND research competitor listicles to understand both the specific offer and market context
- **Identify relevance**: Determine which question categories apply based on what's on the landing page AND what patterns work in the market
- **Ask strategically**: Present ~10 targeted questions with multiple-choice options for quick answers, informed by competitive landscape, not generic 50-100 open-ended questions
- **Enable speed**: Every question has A/B/C/D options so users can answer in under 5 minutes total
- **Provide context**: Questions come with competitive insights (how others handle this, differentiation opportunities)

<intake>
**Let's analyze your offer intelligently.**

Please provide:

1. **Landing page URL** (preferred - allows automatic analysis)
   - OR -
2. **Offer description** (brief: what is it, who is it for, what's the main action)

Optional but helpful:
- What information does your landing page collect?
- Is there any personalization? (calculator, selectors, quiz, etc.)

**I'll analyze what you provide and ask only ~10 questions with multiple-choice options that you can answer in under 5 minutes.**

Wait for response before proceeding.

**All offers use the intelligent analysis workflow:**

workflows/intelligent-offer-analysis.md

This workflow:
1. Analyzes your landing page (if URL provided) to understand your specific offer
2. Researches 2-3 competitor listicles to understand market patterns and positioning
3. Synthesizes insights to identify differentiation opportunities
4. Identifies which question categories are relevant based on both sources
5. Asks only ~10 targeted questions with multiple-choice options (not 50-100 open-ended)
6. Provides A/B/C/D format for quick answers - complete in under 5 minutes
7. Adapts to your specific offer type and competitive landscape automatically
