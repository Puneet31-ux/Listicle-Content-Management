## Step 1: Multi-Source Analysis

### Step 1A: Landing Page Analysis (if URL provided)

If user provides a landing page URL, analyze it comprehensively:

**Read the landing page using WebFetch** and extract:

### Offer Classification
- Primary category (financial/home service/health/tech/other)
- Specific offer type (debt relief, solar installation, health insurance, etc.)
- Conversion goal (form fill, phone call, purchase, quiz completion)

### Information Architecture
- What info is collected? (name, email, phone, debt amount, property address, etc.)
- What's the CTA copy? ("Get My Quote", "See My Savings", "Check Eligibility")
- What personalization exists? (calculators, location-based, debt amount selectors)

### Value Propositions
- Main benefit promised (save money, fix problem, get relief)
- Specific numbers/claims (save $X, reduce by Y%, Z-minute process)
- Proof elements (testimonials, ratings, credentials shown)

### Key Offer Mechanics Visible
- Eligibility requirements mentioned
- Cost/pricing transparency (free, paid, financing options)
- Timeline promises (instant quote, 24-hour response, etc.)
- Guarantees/risk reversals (free quote, no obligation, satisfaction guarantee)

### Psychology & Engagement
- Pain points addressed in copy
- Urgency mechanisms (limited time, seasonal, scarcity)
- Trust signals (licenses, ratings, years in business)
- Engagement type (passive click vs interactive selection)

**Present landing page insights to user:**

```markdown

### Step 1B: Competitive Listicle Research

**Search for and analyze competitor listicles** to understand market positioning and what works:

**Use WebSearch to find:**
1. "best [offer type] 2025" (e.g., "best debt relief programs 2025", "best solar installers for seniors 2025")
2. "[offer type] reviews" or "[offer type] comparison"
3. "[target audience] [offer type]" (e.g., "seniors discount programs", "homeowners solar options")

**Analyze 2-3 top competitor listicles and extract:**

#### Positioning Patterns
- How are similar offers positioned in listicles? (as #1 choice, best for X persona, etc.)
- What unique angles are being used? (most affordable, fastest, best reviews, etc.)
- What comparative framing exists? (vs alternatives, vs doing nothing, vs competitors)

#### Copy & Messaging Themes

#### Information Disclosure Patterns
- What details are revealed in listicle vs hidden for landing page?
- How much pricing/cost info is disclosed?
- What eligibility requirements are mentioned upfront?
- What "secrets" or exclusive info creates click curiosity?

**Present competitive insights to user:**

### Step 1C: Synthesis - What Questions to Ask

**Combine landing page analysis + competitive research to determine:**

1. **What's unique about YOUR offer** vs what competitors show?
2. **What proven patterns** should you follow? (if everyone uses certain trust signals, there's a reason)
3. **What gaps exist** in competitor positioning? (differentiation opportunities)

## Step 2: Identify Relevant Question Categories

Based on Step 1 analysis, determine which categories need deep-dive questions.

**Use this mapping:**

| If landing page has... | Ask questions from... |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Eligibility requirements (age, location, debt amount, property type) | ✓ Core Mechanics: Eligibility & Qualification |
| Pricing/cost information visible | ✓ Core Mechanics: Costs & Fees |
| Multi-step process shown (step 1, 2, 3) | ✓ Core Mechanics: Process & Commitment |
| Strong emotional/pain point copy | ✓ Reader Psychology: Pain Points |
| Specific persona targeting (seniors, homeowners, debt holders) | ✓ Reader Personas & Segmentation |
| Interactive CTAs (calculators, amount selectors, ZIP entry) | ✓ CTA & Engagement: Personalization |
| Urgency language (limited time, act now, deadline) | ✓ CTA & Engagement: Urgency Mechanisms |
| Testimonials, reviews, ratings visible | ✓ Reader Psychology: Social Proof |
| Form with 5+ fields | ✓ Conversion Pathway: Conversion Actions |
| Financing, payment plans mentioned | ✓ Core Mechanics: Costs & Payment |
| Warranties, guarantees prominently shown | ✓ Core Mechanics: Risk & Guarantees |

**Announce relevant categories:**

"Based on analyzing your landing page AND competitor listicles, I'll ask targeted questions from these categories:
- [List 3-4 relevant categories]

This will give you **~10 focused questions with multiple-choice options** for quick answers instead of 50-100 generic open-ended questions. These questions are informed by:
- What your landing page actually offers
- How competitors position similar offers
- What patterns work in this market
- Where differentiation opportunities exist"

## Step 3: Generate Targeted Question Set (~10 questions with options)

Select 1-2 questions from each RELEVANT category identified in Step 2, totaling around 10 questions.

**CRITICAL: Format each question with multiple-choice options for quick selection.**

**Question Selection Priority:**
1. **Must answer** (affects copy accuracy): Persona, value prop, pain points
2. **High impact** (affects conversion): CTA design, emotional hooks, positioning
3. **Strategic decisions**: Pricing disclosure, differentiation angle, proof elements

**Format Requirements:**
- Each question MUST have multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D)
- Options should be specific and actionable (not vague)
- Allow "choose one" or "choose top 2" based on question type
- Include brief context explaining why this matters

### QUESTION BANK BY CATEGORY

Pull questions from these banks based on Step 2 category identification.

**Format all questions with multiple-choice options following this template:**

```
### [Question number]. [Question text]
**Choose one:** (or "Choose top 2:" or "Choose all that apply:")
- [ ] **A) [Option title]** - [Brief description]
- [ ] **B) [Option title]** - [Brief description]
- [ ] **C) [Option title]** - [Brief description]
- [ ] **D) [Option title]** - [Brief description]
- [ ] **E) Other:** _____ (if open-ended fallback needed)

Based on analyzing your landing page AND competitor listicles, these are the essential questions to answer for YOUR specific offer:

### [CATEGORY 1 NAME] ([X] questions)
**Why these matter:** [1 sentence explaining relevance based on landing page + competitive analysis]
**Competitive context:** [1 sentence about how competitors handle this, if relevant]

### 1. [Question text]
**Choose one:** (or appropriate instruction)
- [ ] **A) [Option title]** - [Description]
- [ ] **B) [Option title]** - [Description]

## Quick Answer Format

Just copy and mark your choices like this:
```
1. D - [Option title]
2. B + C - [Option titles for top 2]
3. A, B, D - [All that apply]
...
```

## Next Steps

Once you answer these ~10 questions (should take **under 5 minutes**):
1. I'll help you craft listicle copy that:
   - Opens with the pain points you identified
   - Presents the value proposition clearly
   - Includes the right amount of detail (not too much, not too little)
   - Uses CTAs that trigger engagement
   - Bridges seamlessly to your landing page

2. Your answers will reveal:
   - Which persona to write for
   - What information to include/exclude
   - How to position the offer
   - What CTA language to use
   - What proof/trust signals to emphasize
```

## Step 5: Fallback (No Landing Page URL Provided)

If user doesn't provide landing page URL, you can still do intelligent analysis:

**Option A: User provides offer description**

"I'll research competitor listicles for [offer type] to understand the competitive landscape, then ask targeted questions based on market patterns."

1. Use WebSearch to find 2-3 competitor listicles (Step 1B process)
2. Analyze competitive patterns
3. Ask user 5 quick context questions:
   - What's the main action you want readers to take?
   - What information does your landing page collect?
   - Is there any personalization/interaction?
   - What's your main value proposition?
   - What makes your offer different from competitors?
4. Combine competitive research + user answers to identify relevant categories
5. Select ~10 targeted questions with multiple-choice options

**Option B: User has no URL and minimal details**

Ask expanded context questions:

"To keep this focused on just the questions YOU need to answer, please share:

1. **What type of offer is this?** (brief description: debt relief, solar installation, health insurance, etc.)
2. **What's the main action you want readers to take?** (fill form, call, calculate savings, etc.)
3. **What information does your landing page collect?** (just email, or full form with many fields?)
4. **Is there any personalization/interaction?** (calculators, amount selectors, location entry, quiz, etc.)
5. **What's your main value proposition?** (save $X, fix Y problem, get Z outcome)
6. **Any competitor examples you want to differentiate from?** (optional - helps with positioning)

I'll research competitor listicles and use your answers to ask only the ~10 questions that matter with multiple-choice options for quick answers."

Wait for response, then:
- Research competitor listicles based on offer type (Step 1B)
- Use user answers + competitive insights to map to relevant categories (Step 2 logic)
- Select ~10 questions from those categories with multiple-choice options (Step 3 logic)
- Present with competitive context (Step 4 format)

## Step 6: Usage Guidance

After presenting questions, provide:

**How to Use This Analysis:**

1. **Answer the questions** - Use the landing page, offer details, and customer knowledge
2. **Note what you can't answer** - Gaps reveal unclear positioning or missing information
3. **Connect to copy elements:**
   - **Opening hook** = Pain points + emotional triggers
   - **Value description** = Core mechanics + aspirational state
   - **Qualification language** = Eligibility + persona fit
   - **CTA design** = Engagement mechanics + risk reversal + urgency
   - **Information balance** = What to show in listicle vs hide for landing page
4. **Use for the write-listicle-copy skill** - Your answers become the input for generating actual copy

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- ❌ Can't answer eligibility questions → Offer too vague, will cause landing page bounces
- ❌ Can't identify specific pain points → Copy will be generic and won't resonate
- ❌ Can't articulate "what user is doing" in CTA → Weak engagement, low clicks
- ❌ Landing page surprise elements → Bait-and-switch feel, conversion killer
- ❌ No clear value proposition → Reader won't understand why they should act
</process>
