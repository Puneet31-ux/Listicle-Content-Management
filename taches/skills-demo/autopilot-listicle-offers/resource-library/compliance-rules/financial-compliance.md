## Critical Compliance Rules by Category

### Debt Relief / Debt Settlement

#### FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule (Debt Relief Amendment)

**Prohibited Claims:**
- ❌ Cannot guarantee specific results ("We'll reduce your debt by 50%")
- ❌ Cannot guarantee specific timeframes ("Debt-free in 18 months guaranteed")
- ❌ Cannot claim immediate relief ("Stop collection calls today")
- ❌ Cannot misrepresent credit impact

**Required Disclosures:**
- ✅ "Debt settlement may negatively impact your credit score"
- ✅ Fees must be disclosed upfront (cannot charge before settlement achieved)
- ✅ Must disclose risks of stopping payments to creditors
- ✅ Must mention alternatives (credit counseling, bankruptcy)

**Fee Restrictions:**
- Cannot charge fees until debt is settled or renegotiated
- Must have written agreement signed by consumer
- Consumer can terminate at any time

**Copy Implications:**
- Use "may reduce" not "will reduce"
- Use "typical results" not "guaranteed results"
- Always include credit impact disclosure
- Mention free alternatives exist

---

### High-Yield Savings Accounts / Banking

#### FDIC Insurance Disclosure

**Required:**
- ✅ Must state if FDIC-insured (up to $250,000 per depositor)
- ✅ Cannot imply FDIC insurance if not actually insured
- ✅ Investment products (not FDIC-insured) must clearly state this

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Cannot guarantee returns on investment products
- ❌ Cannot misrepresent insurance or protection

**Grammy Insight:** FDIC-backing is a critical trust signal - mention explicitly if applicable

---

### Credit Cards / Loans

#### Truth in Lending Act (TILA) / Regulation Z

**Required Disclosures:**
- ✅ APR (Annual Percentage Rate) must be clearly stated
- ✅ Fees must be disclosed (annual fees, late fees, etc.)
- ✅ Terms and conditions must be accessible

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ "Teaser rate" bait-and-switch without clear disclosure
- ❌ Hidden fees
- ❌ Misleading "pre-qualified" vs "pre-approved" language

**Copy Implications:**
- State APR upfront if advertising rates
- "Variable rate" products must disclose rate can change
- Clear about "promotional period" end dates

---

### Insurance (Life, Health, Medicare Supplement)

#### State Insurance Regulations (Vary by State)

**General Requirements:**
- ✅ Licensed agents only can sell (verify licensure)
- ✅ Must disclose if comparing to specific competitors
- ✅ Cannot use fear tactics excessively

**Medicare-Specific:**
- ✅ Cannot claim government endorsement
- ✅ Cannot use Medicare logo without permission
- ✅ Must comply with CMS marketing guidelines
- ✅ Enrollment period restrictions

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions (unless true)
- ❌ Misleading benefit comparisons
- ❌ High-pressure sales tactics

**Grammy Context:** Final expense and long-term care insurance mentioned - ensure state-specific compliance

---

### Investment Products / Financial Advice

#### SEC / FINRA Regulations

**Required:**
- ✅ Disclosure if registered investment advisor
- ✅ Risk disclosures for investment products
- ✅ "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results"

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Providing investment advice without proper licensing
- ❌ Guaranteeing investment returns
- ❌ Omitting material risks

**Grammy Context:** Lost $12K on investments - highlight protection/safety in copy, avoid aggressive return promises

---

## State-Specific Considerations

### Solar / Energy (Example: Grammy's Arcadia Solar)

**Varies by State:**
- Some states prohibit certain solar financing claims
- Community solar programs have specific disclosure requirements
- Utility savings claims must be verifiable

**Best Practice:**
- Use "may save" not "will save"
- Provide typical ranges (15-20% savings)
- Disclose any upfront or ongoing costs

---

### Payday Loans / Short-Term Credit

**Heavily Regulated:**
- Many states have specific APR caps
- Required disclosures about costs
- Some states ban entirely

**Best Practice:** Avoid promoting if high regulatory risk

---

## General Best Practices

### 1. Disclaimers

**Placement:**
- Near the claim (not buried at bottom)
- Same size font (or close to it)
- Clear and conspicuous

**Language:**
- Plain English (not legalese)
- Specific (not vague "terms apply")

**Example:**
```
"Typical debt reduction: 30-50%. Results vary based on debt amount,
creditor negotiation, and program completion. Debt settlement may
negatively impact your credit score."
```

---

### 2. Testimonials / Social Proof

**FTC Endorsement Guidelines:**
- ✅ Must reflect typical results (or disclose if exceptional)
- ✅ Must be real customers (not actors unless disclosed)
- ✅ Cannot be misleading

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Fake reviews
- ❌ Paid testimonials without disclosure
- ❌ Atypical results without "not typical" disclosure

**Grammy Context:** Friend testimonials (solar, LTC insurance) are authentic and powerful - use real examples

---

### 3. Comparative Claims

**FTC Advertising Substantiation:**
- ✅ Must have evidence for all claims
- ✅ "Better than X" requires proof
- ✅ Must compare apples to apples

**Example:**
- ✅ "Lower rates than average credit card APR of 27%" (if provable)
- ❌ "Best savings account" (subjective, unprovable)

---

### 4. Urgency / Scarcity Claims

**FTC Prohibition:**
- ❌ False scarcity ("Only 3 spots left" when untrue)
- ❌ Fake countdown timers
- ❌ Misleading "limited time" when offer ongoing

**Grammy Context:** Seniors are skeptical of urgency tactics - avoid entirely for trust

---

## Red Flag Words/Phrases to Avoid

### Financial Services

- ❌ "Guaranteed returns"
- ❌ "Risk-free investment"
- ❌ "Get rich quick"
- ❌ "Eliminate debt in days"
- ❌ "100% approval"
- ❌ "Government-approved" (unless literally true)

### Use Instead:

- ✅ "Potential returns" or "Historical average"
- ✅ "FDIC-insured" (if applicable)
- ✅ "Typical results" with range
- ✅ "May reduce debt by X-Y%"
- ✅ "Check if you qualify"
- ✅ "Federally insured" (if FDIC/NCUA)
