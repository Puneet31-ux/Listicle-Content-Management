# CTA Language Preferences (Senior Audience)

**Source:** Grammy Notes user research
**Applies to:** All senior-focused listicle offers (55+)
**Purpose:** Use CTAs that feel helpful, not pushy

---

## CTA Language Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Preferred (Use These)

#### "Learn More"
- **Grammy's Direct Feedback:** "Learn More MUCH BETTER"
- **Reason:** "Don't want to convert now but want to learn more"
- **Psychology:** Information-seeking, non-committal, respectful
- **Use Cases:** Primary CTA for all senior offers

**Variations:**
- "Learn More About [Offer]"
- "Get More Information"
- "See Full Details"
- "Find Out More"
- "Read More"

---

#### "See [Specific Benefit]"
- **Examples:**
  - "See How Much You Could Save"
  - "See My Monthly Income"
  - "Calculate My Savings"
  - "View My Options"

- **Why It Works:**
  - Specific (not vague)
  - Informational framing
  - Benefit-focused
  - Still low-pressure

---

#### "Get [Free/Info Resource]"
- **Examples:**
  - "Get Your Free Quote"
  - "Get My Free Analysis"
  - "Get Estimate"
  - "Get Info"

- **Why It Works:**
  - "Free" removes risk
  - "Get" implies receiving (not giving)
  - Still informational, not transactional

---

### Tier 2: Acceptable (Use with Caution)

#### "Check [Qualification/Eligibility]"
- **Examples:**
  - "Check If You Qualify"
  - "See If You're Eligible"
  - "Check Availability"

- **Why Acceptable:**
  - Non-committal screening
  - Empowers user ("check" vs "apply")

- **Caution:**
  - Can feel like "you might not qualify" (negative frame)

---

#### "Compare [Options]"
- **Examples:**
  - "Compare Plans"
  - "Compare Rates"
  - "See Your Options"

- **Why Acceptable:**
  - Educational framing
  - Implies choice

- **Caution:**
  - Can feel overwhelming if too many options

---

### Tier 3: Use Sparingly

#### "Get Started"
- **Why Marginal:**
  - Implies commitment
  - Feels like beginning a process (not just learning)

- **When OK:**
  - If process is truly simple (one step)
  - If paired with "Learn More" alternative

- **Grammy Note:** Not explicitly rejected, but "Learn More" strongly preferred

---

#### "Sign Up"
- **Why Marginal:**
  - Feels like commitment
  - "Signing" implies contract

- **When OK:**
  - Free newsletter/info series
  - No payment/obligation

- **Better Alternative:** "Get Free Updates" instead of "Sign Up"

---

### Tier 4: ❌ AVOID (Pushy/Confusing)

#### "Transform" / "Get Ready to Transform"
- **Grammy's Direct Feedback:** Confusing, too pushy
- **Example Rejected:** "Get ready to transform" button
- **Why It Fails:**
  - Vague ("transform" what?)
  - Over-promises
  - Marketing jargon
  - Not action-oriented

**Avoid phrases like:**
- "Transform Your Life"
- "Transform Your Finances"
- "Revolutionize Your..."

---

#### "Claim" / "Claim Your Offer"
- **Why It Fails:**
  - Scammy feel ("claim your prize!")
  - Implies urgency/scarcity
  - Associated with spam

---

#### "Act Now" / "Don't Wait"
- **Why It Fails:**
  - High-pressure tactics
  - Seniors resistant to urgency manipulation
  - Undermines trust

---

#### "Unlock" / "Discover" (when vague)
- **Why It Fails:**
  - Buzzword-heavy
  - Unclear what action user takes
  - Feels like clickbait

---

## Context-Specific CTA Recommendations

### Financial Offers (Savings, Debt, Insurance)

**Primary CTA:**
- "See My Monthly Income" (savings)
- "Calculate My Savings" (debt relief)
- "Get My Free Quote" (insurance)
- "Learn More About Coverage" (insurance)

**Secondary CTA:**
- "Compare Rates"
- "Check If You Qualify"

**Avoid:**
- "Maximize Your Returns" (too aggressive)
- "Transform Your Finances" (vague, pushy)

---

### Home Services (Solar, HVAC, Roofing)

**Primary CTA:**
- "Get Your Free Estimate"
- "See If You Qualify" (community solar)
- "Learn More About [Service]"
- "Calculate My Savings"

**Secondary CTA:**
- "Compare Options"
- "Find Local Providers"

**Avoid:**
- "Book Now" (too committal for first touch)
- "Transform Your Home" (too vague)

---

### Health/Medicare Offers

**Primary CTA:**
- "Learn More About Plans"
- "Compare Coverage Options"
- "Get Free Medicare Guide"
- "See If You Qualify"

**Secondary CTA:**
- "Talk to an Agent" (if non-sales)
- "Get Questions Answered"

**Avoid:**
- "Enroll Today" (too pushy for complex decision)
- "Secure Your Coverage" (sounds urgent/fear-based)

---

## CTA Button Design Principles

### Text Length
- **Ideal:** 2-4 words
- **Maximum:** 6 words
- **Too short:** "Go" (unclear)
- **Too long:** "Click Here to Learn More About Our Amazing Offer" (wordy)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Learn More" (2 words)
- ✅ "Get My Free Quote" (4 words)
- ✅ "See If You Qualify" (4 words)
- ❌ "Find Out Everything You Need to Know" (8 words, too long)

---

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- ✅ "Get Free Estimate" (clear)
- ❌ "Discover Your Potential" (vague)

- ✅ "Compare Rates" (specific action)
- ❌ "Unlock Savings" (buzzword)

- ✅ "Learn More" (straightforward)
- ❌ "Dive Deeper" (trying too hard)

---

### Action vs. Outcome Framing

**Action Framing** (what user DOES):
- "Learn More"
- "Get Info"
- "Compare Options"
- "Calculate Savings"

**Outcome Framing** (what user GETS):
- "See My Monthly Income"
- "Find My Perfect Plan"
- "Get My Free Quote"

**Both work** - choose based on context

---

## Multi-CTA Strategy

### Primary + Secondary Pattern

**Pattern 1: Information + Action**
- Primary: "Learn More" (broad, low-pressure)
- Secondary: "Get Free Quote" (specific, still non-committal)

**Pattern 2: Self-Service + Human Help**
- Primary: "Calculate My Savings" (DIY tool)
- Secondary: "Talk to an Advisor" (human assist)

**Pattern 3: Compare + Choose**
- Primary: "Compare Plans" (exploration)
- Secondary: "See Plan Details" (deeper dive)

---

### Progressive Commitment Pattern

**Stage 1: Awareness**
- CTA: "Learn More" or "Get Info"
- Page: Educational content, trust signals

**Stage 2: Consideration**
- CTA: "Compare Options" or "See If You Qualify"
- Page: Tools, calculators, detailed comparisons

**Stage 3: Decision**
- CTA: "Get Free Quote" or "Request Info"
- Page: Application, contact form

**Grammy Insight:** Seniors often stop at Stage 1 ("Learn More") and return later. Don't force progression.

## Real-World Example from Grammy Feedback

### Test Listicle: https://2025.topdiscountsforseniors.com/default/

**Grammy's Observations:**

**Buttons She Liked:**
- **"Learn more"** - "MUCH BETTER – Don't want to convert now but want to learn more"
- **Context:** Was comparing home reverse mortgage offer

**Buttons She Found Confusing:**
- **"Get ready to transform"** - Too vague
- **"Best value"** → **"Transform your equity"** - Confusing progression
- **"Get ready to transform"** (again) - Inconsistent messaging

**Her Reaction:**
- Couldn't figure out what button would do
- Multiple different CTAs created confusion
- Wanted simple "Learn More" option

**Lesson:** CTA consistency matters. When in doubt, use "Learn More."

## Usage Instructions

When writing CTAs for senior listicles:

1. **Default to "Learn More"** unless you have strong reason otherwise
2. **Be specific** about what happens next ("See Rates" vs "Continue")
3. **Avoid jargon** ("Transform", "Unlock", "Maximize")
4. **Test with target audience** when possible
5. **Consistency across page** (don't mix 5 different CTA styles)
6. **Match stage of funnel** (awareness vs decision)
7. **Provide choice** (primary + secondary CTA when appropriate)

**Remember Grammy's feedback:**
> "Learn More MUCH BETTER – Don't want to convert now but want to learn more"

Seniors want information, not pressure. Respect that and they'll trust you.
