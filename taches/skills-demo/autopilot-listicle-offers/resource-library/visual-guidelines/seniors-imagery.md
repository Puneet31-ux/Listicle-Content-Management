## Model Selection Guidelines

### ✅ DO: "Befuddled" or "Overwhelmed"

**Desired Emotion:** "I could use some help"

**Characteristics:**
- Slightly confused or overwhelmed expression
- Seeking guidance, open to solutions
- Relatable struggle (not despair)
- Approachable, friendly demeanor
- Pleasant but uncertain

**Example Scenarios:**
- Looking at paperwork with mild confusion
- Comparing options on computer, slightly puzzled
- Reading fine print with concerned expression
- Seeking help, not suffering alone

**Why This Works:**
- Mirrors user's actual state ("I need help understanding this")
- Creates empathy without negativity
- Positions offer as helpful guide
- Relatable to real decision-making moments

---

### ❌ DON'T: "Disgruntled" or "Ornery"

**Undesired Emotion:** "There's something wrong with her"

**Characteristics to Avoid:**
- Angry, upset, or bitter expression
- Scowling, frowning, irritated look
- Isolated, suffering alone
- "Ornery" - grumpy, difficult demeanor
- Looks like "there's something wrong with her"

**Why This Fails:**
- Off-putting, unapproachable
- Creates negative emotional association
- Doesn't inspire trust
- User reaction: "That person looks mean/unwell"
- Damages brand perception

## Emotion Spectrum (Senior Imagery)

### ✅ Ideal Range: "Seeking → Hopeful"

```
❌ Too Negative          ✅ Ideal Zone              ❌ Too Positive
-----------------        -----------------         -----------------
Disgruntled              Befuddled                 Overly Happy
Angry                    Overwhelmed               Fake Smile
Suffering                Seeking Help              Stock Corporate
Bitter                   Mildly Confused           Unrealistic Joy
Isolated                 Approachable              Paid Model Feel
```

**Sweet Spot:** Person who needs help but is open to receiving it
