## Core Copywriting Philosophy

### 1. Depth Over Surface
This skill produces deeply researched, psychologically-grounded copy—NOT generic templates. Every line must:
- Connect to specific answered questions from the analysis
- Resonate with identified pain points and motivators
- Use language that mirrors the reader's internal dialogue
- Create "this is me!" recognition moments

### 2. Active Engagement Architecture
Copy must activate readers, not just inform them:
- Interactive CTAs that trigger self-reflection
- Personalization opportunities (select amount, choose state, calculate savings)
- Curiosity gaps that can only be resolved by clicking
- Micro-commitments that build psychological investment

### 3. Research-Backed Authenticity
Every claim, benefit, and psychological trigger must be:
- Grounded in the analysis answers
- Validated through web research (competitive examples, industry data, user psychology studies)
- Specific and measurable (not "save money" but "reduce debt by 30-50%")
- Authentic to the offer's actual value proposition

### 4. Conversion-Focused Journey
Success = reader clicking through AND converting on landing page:
- Set accurate expectations (no bait-and-switch)
- Bridge listicle → landing page seamlessly
- Maintain emotional temperature from awareness to action
- Address objections preemptively

### 5. Multiple Variations for Testing
Generate 3-5 distinct variations that test:
- Different opening hooks (pain-focused vs aspiration-focused vs urgency-focused)
- CTA approaches (calculator-based vs selection-based vs direct)
- Information density (brief vs detailed)
- Emotional temperature (empathetic vs empowering vs urgent)

## Context Gathering

**This skill expects you have already run `/analyze-listicle-offer` in this conversation.**

I will now:
1. **Review the conversation history** to find your completed offer analysis and answered questions
2. **Validate completeness** - ensure all critical questions have answers
3. **Conduct web research** to supplement with:
   - Competitive listicle examples in the same category
   - Industry statistics and data points
   - Psychological triggers specific to this offer type
   - Current trends and messaging approaches

If I cannot find the analysis in conversation history, I will ask you to either:
- Provide the Q&A directly (paste or file)
- Run `/analyze-listicle-offer` first

**Proceeding to locate analysis...**

## Web Research Requirements

**ALWAYS conduct web research for:**

### 1. Competitive Analysis
Search for: "[offer category] listicle examples"
- How do competitors position similar offers?
- What CTA patterns are they using?
- What emotional angles resonate?
- What mistakes should we avoid?

### 2. Industry Data & Statistics
Search for: "[offer category] statistics 2025" + "[specific pain point] data"
- Current market size and trends
- Consumer behavior data
- Success rates and outcomes
- Common objections and concerns

### 3. Psychological Triggers
Search for: "[offer category] consumer psychology" + "conversion optimization [category]"
- What motivates this audience?
- What decision-making frameworks apply?
- What cognitive biases can be leveraged ethically?
- What trust signals matter most?

### 4. Regulatory & Compliance
Search for: "[offer category] advertising regulations" + "[category] disclosure requirements"
- What claims require disclaimers?
- What language is legally risky?
- What transparency is required?
- What ethical boundaries exist?

**Research Execution:**
- Conduct research BEFORE writing copy
- Document sources and data points
- Integrate findings naturally into copy
- Cite specific statistics when used
